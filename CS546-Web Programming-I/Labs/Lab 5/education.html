                In the your year span of my Bachelors degree, I attended numerous classes related to various courses, selecting a single favourite class is a difficult task but if i narrowdown to one class then that would be the SLC(Switching Logic Circuits) class. Undoubtedly the most fun packed learning sessions I ever experienced, working on bread boards, making connections using various logic gates and validating the output for the logic designed. Its good fun and great learning.
                <aside>
                One day in the SLC lecture, one student was asked to design a simple circuit. He came up with a complex circuit and asked one of the girls to switch it ON, to the surprise of entire class, A question poped up as output asking the girl for a date, and she further coninued providing inputs as NO then the loop continued till she entered YES as an answer, his brillliance was cherished by other students but not so by the one girl he wanted. we laughed out so loud that our stomachs started paining. Ome hell of a guy but the girl is real devil.
