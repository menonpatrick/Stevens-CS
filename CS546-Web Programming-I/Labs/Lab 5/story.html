                <p>
                    On the first day, our Head of Department addressed the students (freshmen) with brief intro about college and our department. what we do and how we contribute to the college and society, after that there was student introductions where I saw her, the first impression is like I know this girl, I saw her somewhere. So I reached out to her introduced myself and started talking about each other. In the first meeting itself I realised that we have somany things in common and we can be a great team. From that day our relationship strengthend and we became best friends eventually.

                    While talking to my friend, I saw a girl laughing out loud and screaming in joy, for a silent guy like me she is an absolute headache. "What a painful girl"  I murmured to myself. Unfortunately she saw me doing so and started a heated argument with me. I could do nothing and as I dont like saying sorry, I ignored her. That fight prolonged fueled by numerous reasons and somewhere inbetween those arguments I fell for her without even realising. She even shouted that she is in love with me and blamed me for being like that. Really what a painful girl. A pain i love to carry the rest of my life.
